# About The Project

Just a simple loader managable by buttons, it works as a regular timer

## Problem statement
Overview:

Creating a loading bar that every 0.1 seconds increases 1% of completion. It should have a start button, a reset button, and a stop button. It should have a text label indicating the percentage rate.
 
Requirements:
* Every 0.1 seconds the bar should increase 1%.
* The start button should begin the bar percentage increments.
* The stop button should stop the bar percentage increments.
* The reset button should reset the progress to zero.
* If the progress bar percentage is 100%, the stop and start buttons should be disabled and the reset button should be enabled.
* If the progress bar percentage is 0%, the stop and reset buttons should be disabled and the start button should be enabled.
* If the progress bar is currently increasing, the start button should be disabled and the reset and stop buttons should be enabled.
